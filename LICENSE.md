## Philosophy: "Use What's Provided"

VonCMS is designed to work **out of the box**:

1. **Everything you need is included** — No additional setup required
2. **Customize through Admin Panel** — No coding needed for normal use
3. **Extend with PHP** — API files can be modified if needed
4. **Core system as-is** — JavaScript remains compiled by design
