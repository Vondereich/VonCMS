## 🌟 What is VonCMS?

VonCMS is a modern, high-performance **Content Management System** designed for speed, simplicity, and real-world usage. It combines a **React Single-Page Application (SPA)** frontend with a lightweight **PHP** backend, delivering an experience that feels more like a mobile app than a traditional CMS.

Unlike many traditional CMS platforms that can feel heavy or sluggish, VonCMS focuses on instant loading, smooth navigation, and zero-friction installation — even for non-technical users.
